            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. This comes in handy if you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version or layout of your projects. Which in most cases you do, we all have accidentally overwritten files and desperatley try to go back to the original verson. Verson control solves this problem while allow you to compare your progress over time. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As most good things come into existence, git had a lot of issues in the early stages of its development. The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large compacity and for most of the development of the Linux kernel maintenance, changes to the software were passed using archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary version control called BitKeeper. As, time went one the relationship between the linux community and BitKeeper began to deteriorate. This in turn prompted the linux community to develope their own tools using what they learned from BitKeeper. In turn Git was born maintaining its original focus Git can takle large projects with speed and efficiency. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The major difference between Git and any other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data. Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. Most operations in Git only need local files and resources to operate generally no information is needed from another computer on your network. This makes Git super fast. Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. The basic workflow is as follows: You modify files in your working directory, You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area, You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To get a Git project to repository there are two main approaches. The first takes an existing project or directory and imports it into Git. The second clones an existing Git repository from another server.In this summary I will just mention how to do the first.If you’re starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to go to the project’s directory and type: $ git init- This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files – a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet.If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few git add commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a git commit:
                $ git add *.c
                $ git add LICENSE
                $ git commit -m 'initial project version'
                </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are everything else – any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the git status command. After checking the status of your files you should make your staging area the way you want it, and commit your files.</p>
